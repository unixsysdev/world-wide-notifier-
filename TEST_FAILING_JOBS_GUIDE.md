# Test Failing Jobs Guide

## Overview
This guide shows how to create test jobs that will fail, allowing you to test the Failed Jobs functionality.

## Prerequisites
- The world-wide-notifier application is running
- You have a user account and are logged in
- Python 3 is installed on your system

## Steps to Create Test Failing Jobs

### 1. Get Your Authentication Token
1. Open your browser and log into the application
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the Application/Storage tab
4. Find "Local Storage" â†’ Your app URL
5. Copy the value of the "token" key

### 2. Run the Test Script
```bash
# From the project root directory
python create_test_failing_jobs.py YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with the token you copied from localStorage.

### 3. View the Failed Jobs
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for the jobs to execute and fail
2. Go to your application dashboard
3. Click on the "ðŸ”§ Failed Jobs" tab
4. You should see the failed jobs listed there

## What the Test Jobs Do

The script creates several test jobs that will fail for different reasons:

1. **Invalid Domain** - Uses a non-existent domain to trigger DNS failure
2. **Connection Timeout** - Uses a URL that will timeout
3. **404 Error** - Uses a URL that returns 404
4. **Invalid URL Format** - Uses a malformed URL
5. **Server Error** - Uses a URL that returns 500 error
6. **SSL Certificate Error** - Uses a URL with SSL issues
7. **Rate Limited** - Uses a URL that returns 429 rate limit error

## Clean Up
After testing, you can delete these test jobs from the dashboard to clean up your job list.

## Example Usage
```bash
# Example command
python create_test_failing_jobs.py eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

# Expected output:
# Creating test jobs that will fail...
# âœ… Created job: ðŸš¨ Test - Invalid Domain
#    ðŸ”„ Triggered immediate execution for ðŸš¨ Test - Invalid Domain
# âœ… Created job: ðŸš¨ Test - Connection Timeout
#    ðŸ”„ Triggered immediate execution for ðŸš¨ Test - Connection Timeout
# ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create job" errors
- Check that your token is valid and not expired
- Ensure the API service is running on localhost:8000
- Verify you're logged in to the application

### Jobs not appearing in Failed Jobs tab
- Wait a few minutes for the jobs to execute
- Check the Live Monitor tab to see if jobs are running
- Refresh the Failed Jobs tab
- Check the API service logs for any errors

### Token issues
- Make sure you copied the complete token from localStorage
- Check that the token hasn't expired (login again if needed)
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the token
